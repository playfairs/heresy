## Quick Fixes
- Cogs: Fun, Ratelimit have been fixed, issue was due to missing imports, but those imports are now fixed and have new names.
- PostgreSQL Dependencies and Modules have been reinstalled and PosgtreSQL has been reinitialized, all Databases have also been restored, so nothing has been lost, this issue was the reason the bot was offline temporarily.
