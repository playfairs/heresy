## What's New?
- Last.FM: New command `last` which shows your last played track.


## Playfairs.cc
- Updated the bots tab on the website to have a Dashboard, which is currently available at [heresy.vercel.app](https://heresy.vercel.app)


## Improvements
- Updated the `whois` command, nothing detrimental was changed, just changed some hyprlinking and hrefs.
- Changed the color of `last` from white to red to determine the difference between `last` and `np`.
- Updated the `recent` command embed to be more visually appealing.

## Known Issues
- No known issues.


## Coming Soon
- Specifically for [heresy](https://heresy.vercel.app/), I plan to sync the commands tab to be accurate with the bot and all the commands, but this will take a while, as I plan to buy a VPS, a few Servers, and plan to make an API for Heresy, all of this wil be done around the time I verify the bot.
