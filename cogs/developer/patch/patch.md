## What's New?
- Changed the bots name from Heresy to Flesh, the bot will remain the same just under a different name.
- Heresy, or Flesh, will now be spilt into 2 different bots, one for Production Build, and one for Developer Build, the Production Build will remain as the bot it is right now, and the Developer Build will be the bot that gets actively worked on, and when there are no bugs, or no futher needed improvements, it gets pushed to the Production Build. (Please note that the Developer Build will NOT be in the main server but will be in a Testing server)


## Playfairs.cc
- Updated the bots tab on [playfairs.cc](https://playfairs.cc/flesh)


## Improvements
- Updated the bots Requirements.txt for easier installation of Packages, also removed audioop-lts from the requirements as the Package seems to either be fixed by Audioop or was removed from PyPI.


## Known Issues
- Not entirely an issue, but the bot will treat all uppercase as lowercase even if the context is not a command or subcommand but rather a message for example.


## Coming Soon
- Will work on FuzzyWuzzy for command capitalisation, to allow for the bot to work with both lower and upper case, while pertaining the upper case in commands such as afk, when giving a input in caps.
