## What's New?
- Updated the owners command to include contributors.
- Updated the `/about` command, to both fix the issue with missing Heresy option, and reworked the Embed.
- Updated the `mc` command to be more detailed, or informative.


## Playfairs.cc
- 1 new gif has been added, and tailwindcss has been updated.
- Changed from using just react to React with Remix.

Will be changing more to the website as its branch is also being updated just like Heresy, these changes wont be noticable until its ready.


## Improvements
- AFK: Updated both the AFK command and embeds, and listeners, so they look a small bit different.
- Fixed SOME of the commands which show the time, the time now shows the CLIENT time, not the time of the ctx.author (The person who sent the command).
- Updated Branch, is still HEAD:main, but both branches are up to date, this does not affect the current state of the bot.
