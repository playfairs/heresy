## What's New?
- LastFM: Updated `plays` commands such as `sp`, `ap` and `plays`, this is now a command group, running just `plays` runs the normal plays command, invoking with `track` or `artist` shows plays for those artists or songs.
- bp: This command purges messages sent by the bot in DM's, this can only be ran by the owner.
- e: Added a new gif to the `e` command group.
- Invite: Allows users to now add they bot to a server by sending `invite`, this was available on the website, but found it much easier this way.
- `cogs.owner`: Added new commands to the `cogs.owner` cog, `sudo`, `screenshot`, `open`, `ball`.
