## What's New
- Nothing new has been changed, nor added.

## Quick Fixes
- No quick fixes at the moment.

## Known Issues
- Lastfm is currently not working, or at least is not working to a certain extent, with randomly outputting and spamming error `Error fetching Last.fm data: 200, message='Attempt to decode JSON with unexpected mimetype: text/html; charset=utf-8', url='https://www.cbs.com'`, this will be fixed but until then the cog will be unloaded to prevent anything breaking the bot.
- Issue with the bots hosting where when the localhost goes to sleep the bot also closes shards, which didn't happen before, will most likely fix this soon by potentially hosting a server for the bot with Debain, this might take a while to setup though and won't be happening until then.
